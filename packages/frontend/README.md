## Adding a new background template

1. Add a new template to `BACKGROUND_TEMPLATES` in `app/features/editor/consts/templates.ts` following a similar pattern. Give it suitable name, feel free to be creative.
2. Define the necessary clip-path CSS variables in `app/features/editor/styles/TemplatePreview.module.css`.
3. Create the new class in `.backgroundTemplate-previewSection` within `app/features/editor/styles/TemplatePreview.module.css` based on the new template `previewStyles` property you added.
